# PatchouLINE

ESC204 Praxis III Engineering Design Project

PatchouLINE aims to increase the yield of patchouli plants in Indonesia by providing farmers with information about soil quality. A sensor deployment system is mounted on a zipline-guided cart movement design to collect soil moisture readings at regular intervals. Wi-Fi communication is implemented to transfer data wirelessly to farmers, who can interact with a webpage and heatmap to learn about the soil quality of each plot to better allocate resources.

This repository retains the folder structure of the SharePoint submission, but only contains the code files.
